1.
Data Persistence: Databases ensure that the poems' data remains intact between application restarts, user sessions, and server deployments. This permanence is essential for maintaining a consistent user experience and data integrity.

Scalability: As the application grows, so does the amount of data. Databases are designed to handle vast quantities of data efficiently, supporting scalability in web applications. This capability allows for adding more poems or expanding the application's features without significant performance degradation.

Data Organization and Retrieval: Databases provide structured ways to organize data in tables, rows, and columns, making it easier to store, search, and retrieve information. For instance, poems are stored with attributes like title, author, and text in a structured format, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Dynamic Content: The dynamic display of poems on the website is facilitated by the database. It allows for the storage of various poems and their display through the Flask application, making the web content dynamic and interactive.

2.
Data Manipulation: SQL provides powerful yet intuitive syntax for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. This manipulation capability is essential for the initial population of the poems table and subsequent retrieval of poem data for display.

Complex Queries: SQL supports complex querying capabilities, such as filtering, sorting, joining, and aggregation. These features enable developers to perform sophisticated data analysis and retrieval operations, tailoring the application's data presentation to the user's needs.

Standardization and Compatibility: SQL is widely supported by various database management systems (DBMS), making it a universal language for database interaction. This standardization ensures that skills and applications are portable across different databases.

Efficiency and Performance: SQL commands are optimized by the database system to execute operations as efficiently as possible. This efficiency is critical for web applications, where fast response times and minimal latency are essential for a positive user experience.
